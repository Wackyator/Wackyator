### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tarun, I like to build tools and learn new stuff.
I'm familiar with multiple programming languages but consider myself most proficient in Rust and Python. 
I've previously worked at [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev) to create [py-rattler](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/py-rattler).
