### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tarun, I like to build tools and learn new stuff, currently I'm working at [prefix.dev](https://github.com/prefix-dev) and learning about package management.
I'm familiar with multiple programming with multiple programming languages but consider myself most proficient in Rust and Python.
